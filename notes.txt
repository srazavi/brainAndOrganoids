To do:
- Try changing the assignment of meta data frame to ad.varm rather than ad.var
(see: https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anndata.AnnData.html, notes, par. 2)

Need rules on wildcard search, as some gene variants (especaially with different numbers at the end) are present in the dataset. 

I was confused about why HepaCAM was not included in the list of variables when I check for lower cased substrings both ways, but the format of the gene names in the dataset makes this useful only in one direction (dataset format: "HEPACAM|HEPACAM".

To do:
- Find out why that is a useful format
- Add wildcard comparison of gene names to check for matches, using regular expressions
